Repo Browser is an HTTP server started within the TDA Lua context that serves
diagram data in JSON format.

To make it serve regular files you must set XAVANTE_WEB variable in server.lua
file to the path of your web directory:
    XAVANTE_WEB = "C:\\Users\\kaka\\Desktop\\WORK\\tda-web\\public"

Now all HTTP requests prefixed with "/tda_web/" will be served as files from
that directory. Example request:
    http://localhost:8080/tda_web/index.html

See server.lua file for other types of requests that the server supports.

The file
    TdaFramework/Bin/lua/main.lua
is used to start the server (i.e., it is executed when user presses the L key).
Below are the contents of main.lua before it was removed from source control.
